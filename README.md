"AAAAHHHHHHHHH I'M ON FIRE HELP ME"  
"Just do the Stop, Drop N Roll!"  
"Oh I'm okay now, thank you!"  

Do you always find yourself on fire? Well me too. But don't worry! You can do the Stop, Drop N Roll to put yourself out!

Stop Drop N Roll adds the ability to crouch and extinguish yourself. By default, it shortens the remaining time you are flammable by a percentage and may not always succeed. These options are configurable, so you can make it always succeed and completely extinguish yourself!

## Features

- Crouch to extinguish the flames
- Modify the chance to extinguish the flames
- Modify how long each success removes from the remaining flame time

### Planned

- Configurable option to require spinning while crouched (Roll)
- Configurable required spinning speed (or faster spins puts it out faster)
- Advancements

## Usage

To use this mod you just need to be on fire, and spam crouch until your no longer on fire!

### Configuration

There are currently two options in the config file which can be found in `<minecraft directory>/config/stop-drop-n-roll.properties`.

`chance` - The chance that a single crouch will succeed in reducing the time remaining  
`fire-tick-remove-percentage` - The amount that will be removed from the remaining fire ticks  
Both of these options are from 0-1. 0 is 0%, 1 is 100% and 0.32 would be 32%
